I have made everything end-to-end using the Wix Website Editor along with their Dev Velo Mode. It was purely based on the theme they asked for along with a blog-like feature where they can post their reviews.",

I had to learn a lot of things to make this website including React, Gatsby, GraphQL, CSS, and a lot of other things. I have always wanted to make my own website for my portfolio instead of using a website builder so that I can have the flexibility I want. I hosted this website using AWS S3 along with AWS Cloudfront.",
